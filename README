Problem Statement
Classify movie reviews as positive or negative using the text of
the review. 


Environment: Google Colab w/ Hardware Accelerator (GPU enabled)


Tools and Libraries used:
- Tensorflow
- Keras
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn


DL Model: RNN-LSTM & CNN

Project Description:
Use the IMDb Dataset that contains the text of 50,000 movie 
reviews from the Internet Movie Database. These are split into 
25,000 reviews for training and 25,000 reviews for testing. The 
training and testing sets are balanced. The program loads the 
dataset into a RNN LSTM Model to classify the dataset into 
positive or negative. For importing the IMDb dataset, I have 
directly loaded it from the "keras.datasets". But we can download it
=> https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/aclImdb_v1.tar.gz 
Loading dataset directly from keras is convenient although not all 
datasets are available in their database.


Instructions to Run the Code:
- Please find the attached python notebook named: 
  "Sentiment_Ananlysis_IMDb_RNN_LSTM.ipynb".
- Open it and set Hardware Accelerator to GPU enabled in the notebook 
  settings for better speed.
- For execution, do run all or sequentially run each code block.


Results:
The last block of the code provides the evaluation of the code 
performance. 
2 graphs will be printed which demonstrate the accuracy of the 
model through epochs for both train and test datasets, as well as the 
loss of the model for the same. 
Finally, the overall accuracy of the model and total execution 
time will be printed.
